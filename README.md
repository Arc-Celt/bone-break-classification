# Bone Break Classification

The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network model to automate the classification of bone fractures from X-ray images. By training a deep learning model on a diverse set of fracture types, we aim to create a system capable of providing accurate and timely insights to medical professionals, thereby enhancing patient care. This model will assist in identifying various types of fractures, such as:

- Avulsion fractures
- Comminuted fractures
- Fracture-dislocations
- Greenstick fractures
- Hairline fractures
- Impacted fractures
- Longitudinal fractures
- Oblique fractures
- Pathological fractures
- Spiral fractures

By leveraging CNNs implemented in PyTorch, the project aims to streamline the fracture diagnosis process, offering valuable data-driven support for better decision-making.
